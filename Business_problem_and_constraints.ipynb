    "### So before giving loan, bank has to do some research on the person to whom bank is providing the loan\n",
    "### for every individual they cannot do research, so what banks basically do is they issue a form and ask individual to fill up the form\n",
    "### in the form they mention some parameters and ask individual to fill up, based on those features bank will come to decide wheater to approve loan or not\n",
    "### every individual form banks cannot go through and decide, for that need lot of human efforts\n",
    "### finally what banks do is they will comeup with a model to tell wheather to approve the loan for individual or not\n",
    "### they will train the machine learning algorithm on the dataset that they have prepared or from the past loans history\n",
    "### for the future perosns, from which individuals fill up from there they collect information then will ask model to let us know whether to provide loan or not "
